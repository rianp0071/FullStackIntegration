How Microsoft Copilot Helped:

Copilot helped by bringing my visions to life. I knew what I wanted to do and copilot provided me with an extremely quick setup with just the features I needed. After, it was able to automate basic tasks like data binding, generating api calls, etc. It was also able to help me debug and suggested to add CORS for cross platform compatibility.
